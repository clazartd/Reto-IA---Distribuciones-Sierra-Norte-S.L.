# System Patterns

## System Architecture Overview
_Describe the system’s architecture (layers, subcomponents, and their interactions). Use diagrams when helpful._

## Key Technical Decisions
- _Record important technical choices (frameworks, libraries, protocols, tradeoffs)._

## Design Patterns in Use
- _List, explain, and rationalize major design or coding patterns being used (e.g., MVC, Dependency Injection, Microservices, etc)._

## Critical Implementation Paths
- _Document flows that are crucial for the system’s correct functioning. Add diagrams or sequence flows where useful._

## Component Relationships
- _Describe how major modules/components interact and depend on each other._
